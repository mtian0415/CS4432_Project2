Run "StartUp" class from src/simpledb.server
Run "CreateTable" class from studentclient/simpledb.smartmergejoin, wait until it completes
Run "RunQuery" class from studentclient/simpledb.smartmergejoin, this will take a while because it's doing the query for 10000 records.
The result should show a compare of unsorted vs sorted. Sorted takes much shorter time.

Every time run it, need to delete the 4432db folder completely.
